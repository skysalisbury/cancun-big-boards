## Next Steps:
* Adding an admin or moderator, so that higher ups can modify prospects, instead of needing to use mongoDB in order to change prospects created by other Users.
* Adding comments on Boards or even prospects themselves as users might want to give input on other user's boards or even descriptions of prospects.
* Adding multiple tabs, schemas and routes depending on the new entity as this can scale outside of basketball and even sports, ranking favorite characters, movies, music, etc. This application can be used in a multitude of different ways all using the Big Board.
* installing a package to count recent player stats and connecting it to prospect cards during college season, etc so that the updates help during early parts of scouts seasons.
* Adding clips to prospect cards on boards, so users can show clips highlighting their evaluations of those prospects.
